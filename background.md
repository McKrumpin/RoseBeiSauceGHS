# Our Story

Founded in the heart of Mt. Vernon, Rose~Bei Sauce Company began as a labor of love in the kitchen of our founder, Paul Troupe. With a passion for exquisite flavors and a commitment to using only the finest local ingredients, Rose~Bei set out to create a line of sauces that would tantalize taste buds and bring joy to every meal. What sets us apart is our unwavering dedication to quality. We work closely with local artisans, carefully selecting the freshest produce and spices, ensuring that each batch of our sauces bursts with vibrant flavors. We believe that great food starts with great ingredients, and we're proud to support the local community while delivering exceptional taste to our customers.
