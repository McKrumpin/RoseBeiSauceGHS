# Here is what people are saying about our sauce!

"Best sauce, made a bomb ass chicken and rice with it. Teriyaki sauce is the best I’ve tried, definitely gonna get more. Recommend 10/10."
- Ethan B. 

"There are hundreds of not thousands of marinades and sauces, I believe I have tried many and not one of them has given me the wow factor! I am almost out of the RosieBeisauce, and have used it on chicken, venison and beef! Perfect amount of spices and not over salty! Definitely will be a repeat customer, keep up the great work."
- Brett D.

"My wife and I have tried all 3 sauces it's a total change from the ordinary sauces out there! We've had them with wings, fried shrimp, and deep fried turkey legs! I guarantee you'll order more!"
- DeWayne M.

"I really liked their sauces that I tried and can't wait to purchase more for future meals and cooking. I highly recommend these products for the use in your cooking choices. These sauces will make the bland much more flavorable, especially the meat you choose. I can't wait to try them on beef products."
- Brent L.

"I've used the sauce for several dishes from chicken to sushi to burgers.  The sauce is really tasty and isn't too sweet or salty. I will definitely continue to use the sauce since I'm a fan and the kids really like the sauce. Great products."
- Christopher T.

"I was amazed with the taste.  I used it to bake chicken,  I marinaded my chicken overnight & I put some fresh sauce over it the next day to bake.  The end result was delicious & I was very pleased."
- Freda A.

"I have never been a big teriyaki fan. But when I had this special sauce I couldn’t have licked my lips more than eating my grandmother's cooking. It was so sweet and tangy had my mouth exploding with flavors, once you try it you will never try any other sauce again."
- Rasheeda B.

"Teriyaki sauce is a family favorite in my home. Which is why we were so pleased to try the spicy teriyaki. It was absolutely delicious! When we first tried it , we sampled it on the first foods available to us which was raw veggies, carrots, celery and broccoli. 
It was delicious and we couldn’t wait to have it on our chicken and fish. It made for an excellent addition.  The flavor is spot on with the perfect texture. Can’t wait to try more." 
- Mark S.

"Best teriyaki sauce I've tasted. My family puts that stuff on every thing. A miracle product,  since it helps my children eat their vegetables. Need to order a larger amount of this treat."
- Klaus M.

"I have sampled all of the flavors and all of them are wonderful! Our household has fallen in love with teriyaki sauces. The "Mild" is perfect for one of my sons who has a sensitive stomach. He now looks at the store sauces and shakes his head, never again, as long as Rose-Bei Sauce Co. is around he will never buy from the store again."
