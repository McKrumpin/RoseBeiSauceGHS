# Just Another Simulation

![Placeholder](assets/images/placeholder.png)

We are a small local business, that wanted to make a healthier teriyaki sauce, that tastes great. Our product doesn't have all the filler of most brands. No high fructose corn syrup, no xanthan gum, no starch added, and no thickeners. 

Just great flavors. Flavors that works as a marinade for chicken, beef, pork, fish, sea food, and stir fry vegetables. It's a great all around sauce, or you can just use it as a dipping sauce.

Our product have been tested by "Washington State School of food Pullman WA". It also been shelf life tested by" Exact Scientific Testing" in Ferndale Washington. It is bottled at "Wolf Packers International" in Gold bar Wa.
